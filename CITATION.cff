abstract: |
  Modern LLMs can accept long contexts, but still degrade under high information 
  density, suffer from mid-context underutilization, and face cost blow-ups when 
  used as "memory" by stuffing everything into prompts. Memory Statue v2 proposes 
  a structured external memory system blueprint: an end-to-end memory architecture 
  (agent + store + retrieval + maintenance + harness) paired with a structured 
  memory store and retrieval lens called Memory Crystal (capsules + indices + 
  policies). The design emphasizes deterministic schemas, governed promotion of 
  "canonical" beliefs, append-only audit trails, and drift reduction via measurable 
  defect metrics and maintenance routines.
