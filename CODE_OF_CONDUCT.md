# Code of Conduct

This project exists to help the community test, validate, and extend the ideas in **Memory Statue v2** responsibly and constructively.

## Our standard
Be excellent to each other.

That means:
- **Be respectful.** Critique ideas, not people.
- **Be precise.** When you disagree, explain *why* with evidence, examples, or clear reasoning.
- **Be collaborative.** Assume good intent; ask clarifying questions before escalating.
- **Be inclusive.** Welcome newcomers and different backgrounds.
- **Be responsible.** Avoid sharing private information, doxxing, harassment, or hateful content.

## Good-faith technical disagreement is welcome
This project *expects* debate. In fact, if nobody disagrees, something is probably wrong.  
Disagreement is productive when it is:
- anchored to reproducible claims,
- stated clearly and kindly,
- paired with proposed fixes or experiments.

## Unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, threats, hate speech, or discriminatory language
- Sexual content or unwanted attention
- Publishing private/confidential information
- Repeated disruptive behavior after being asked to stop

## Reporting and enforcement
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:
- Open a GitHub issue labeled **conduct** *or*
- Contact the maintainer directly (preferred for sensitive reports)

The maintainer will respond as promptly as possible and may take actions including:
- requesting changes,
- removing content,
- temporarily or permanently restricting participation.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any community channels tied to this repository.

Thank you for helping make this a rigorous and welcoming place to build.
