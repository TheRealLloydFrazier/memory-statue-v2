Memory Statue v2: Availability & Licensing
Version 1.4.4 (2026-01-29)

This work is intended to be used, tested, and extended by the community.

LICENSING STANCE
This release is source-available and non-commercial (i.e., it should not be 
treated as OSI "open source," because commercial use is restricted).

NON-COMMERCIAL USE (PERMISSION GRANTED)
Permission is granted, free of charge, to use, copy, modify, and build upon 
this manuscript and its accompanying artifacts for research, education, personal 
study, and other non-commercial purposes, provided that:
  (i) proper attribution is given to the author and this paper, and 
  (ii) any redistributed copies retain this section (or an equivalent 
       licensing notice).

COMMUNITY REQUEST (NON-BINDING)
Users are encouraged to share back use cases, implementation notes, and 
empirical findings/breakthroughs—publicly or privately, and anonymized/redacted 
is acceptable. Sharing back is requested to accelerate validation and reduce 
duplicated effort, but it is not a condition of the non-commercial permission 
grant.

COMMERCIAL USE
Any use primarily intended for commercial advantage or monetary compensation 
requires a separate, negotiated license with the author on a case-by-case basis.

COLLABORATION NOTE
Teams interested in running test cases or proofs of concept with the author to 
generate empirical evidence are encouraged to collaborate; such collaborations 
may be eligible for special licensing consideration.
