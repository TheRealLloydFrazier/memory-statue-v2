# Release Files

This folder contains the compiled PDF and other release artifacts.

## Contents

- `Memory_Statue_v2_v1_4_4_arxiv_source_DOI.pdf` - Compiled PDF (upload here)

## Canonical Archive

The canonical archived release lives on Zenodo:

## Note

Upload your compiled PDF to this directory. Alternatively, you can skip this folder and only link to the Zenodo DOI in the main README (which is the minimal approach).
